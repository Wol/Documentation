== MagicQ Concepts
A system diagram of the console is shown in the diagram below

image:images/systemdiagram.png[image]

* 64 universes except MQ40 (4), MQ60 (12), MQ70 (12), and MQ100 Expert
(12). Older consoles such as MQ Pro support 18 and MQ Pro 2010 supports
32.

=== Show Storage

MagicQ stores show data in a single show file stored on the hard drive of the MagicQ console, PC or Mac.  The show file contains all the show settings, patch, palettes, cues and cue stack data.  It also stores copies of all the personalities that are used within the show.

A MagicQ show can be transferred between MagicQ consoles and MagicQ PC or Mac systems simply by copying the show file.  MagicQ show files are compatible across all MagicQ products.  MagicQ maintains forward and backward compatibility for show files - enabling users to load shows created on any version of MagicQ software into any other version fo MagicQ software.

Favourite shows, personalities, palettes and FX patterns can be imported into new shows to simplify and speed up show programming.

Show files can be copied using USB memory sticks or the network can be used to access the file system of MagicQ consoles.

When the user saves the show using the SAVE SHOW menu item or soft button MagicQ stores the show file with a .shw file extension.  At all other times MagicQ automatically backs up the show data whenever changes are made to a (.sbk) file.  

=== Output channels

MagicQ supports up to 64 DMX512 universes output over Ethernet.
This allows up to 32,768 channels of lighting to be controlled.
Ethernet to DMX Interfaces are used to convert from Ethernet to serial DMX512
as required.

Lighting consoles are often limited in the number of DMX channels or the
number of intelligent heads they can control independently.  MagicQ allows control of all DMX channels individually, whilst utilising
grouping and programming functions to enable control of multiple heads
or dimmers together.

MagicQ provides a library of over 10,000 personalities – data for each of the
different types of intelligent head available. This data determines how
the different attributes of an intelligent head are controlled by the
console.

ChamSys adds new personalities for fixtures as the information for new fixtures becomes available.  If a personality is not available then it can be requested from ChamSys.  Users also have the ability to create the persoanlity themselves in the inbuilt Head Editor.


==== HTP / LTP channels

The console supports two types of channels, highest takes precedence
(HTP) and latest takes precedence (LTP). Generally HTP channels are used
for channels controlling dimmers and for the dimmer channel of
intelligent heads. LTP channels are used for the attributes of
intelligent heads such as pan, tilt, colour, gobo etc…

For HTP channels the value that is output is the
highest value of that channel on all of the active playbacks and the
programmer. The console can be configured so that if a HTP channel is in
the programmer it always overrides any active playbacks.

For LTP channels the value output is the value from the last active
playback unless that channel is active in the programmer in which case
the value output is the value stored in the programmer.

The last active playback is the last playback to be raised above zero,
which is still above zero. Playbacks that are bumped in using ADD or
SWAP buttons automatically become the last active playback until the
button is released.

The type of channel used by the console is determined by the personality
used to patch the dimmer or intelligent head.

Playbacks can be set so that all channels controlled by the Playback act
in a LTP way, thus allowing Intensity channels to be overridden by a
single Playback.


=== Cues

The console stores lighting states as Cues – each Cue stores

* Level information
* Timing information
* FX information

The Cue stores level information for each of the channels recorded into
it. If the channel level was set using a Palette, then a reference to
the Palette is also stored so that the Cue can keep track of changes to
the Palette.

The Cue stores timing information for the channels that have been
recorded into it. Two types of timing information are stored:

General Times:

Stored for each type of attribute (Int In, Int Out, Position, Colour,
Beam)

Individual Times:

Stored on an individual channel basis


The Cue stores FX information for each of the FX that has been recorded
into the Cue. The FX information includes the type of FX, the heads that
the FX is applied to, and the FX parameters for each head.

Each Cue has a number (e.g. Q1) and an optional name.



=== Cue Stacks

Cue Stacks are used to manage sequences of Cues. Cue Stacks keep track
of the order of the Cues and the options for how they are played back. A
Cue Stack may have only one Cue associated with it or may have a whole
list of Cues.

The Cue Stack stores a Cue Id and a textual field for each Cue so that
the different steps in the stack can be labelled. The Cue Id and textual
field are shown on the playback display when the stack is played back
which enables operators to keep track of the current position in the
show.

Cue Stacks can be configured to run as a chase rather than as a simple
list of Cues. The difference is that as a chase each the timing of cue
is determined by the chase speed and chase contrast rather than by the
individual delay and fade times for each cue.

Each Cue Stack has a number (e.g. CS1) and an optional name.


=== Playbacks

The console enables playing of recorded show data through Playbacks.
Playbacks are associated with physical faders and buttons – each
Playback can have one cue stack assigned to it.

The console supports 202 Playback; 10 main Playbacks situated below the
touch screen and up to 8 extension wings each with 24 Playbacks.

On models where less than 8 wings are fitted, the not fitted playbacks
can be utilised through the touch screen and associated buttons.


=== Pages

The console supports multiple pages of Playbacks enabling Playback
faders to have different functions depending on the current page.
Typically one page is used for each song in a show.

The current page is selected through the NEXT PAGE and PREV PAGE buttons
on the main playback section or by selecting a page in the Page Window.

The 24 Playbacks on each wing are divided up into two rows of 12
Playbacks. Each of the rows has separate NEXT PAGE and PREV PAGE
buttons. This enables the Page used by these Playbacks to be set
differently to the main Playbacks.

This provides significant flexibility to how shows are played back – for
example one section of a wing can be used to control par lamps whilst
another could be used to control intelligent heads. Changing the Page of
the par lamps would not change the Page of the heads.


=== FX

The console contains a powerful engine for creating special effects
(FX). FX can be applied to a group of heads at the touch of a button;
there is no need to program lots of different Cues to create the effect.
Special effects can be easily modified live, enabling, for example, the
speed and size of the FX to be modified to match the mood of the show.

The console supports an extensive library of standard FX such as
circles, squares, pan and tilt saws, lifts, zig zags, etc. In addition
the console supports FX on colour, beam and intensity attributes. The
console supports programming and storing of new custom FX, which can
then be re-used in shows as required. The FX engine enables complete
shows to be programmed within a matter of minutes.



=== Window Layouts

The console provides a means of storing the positions and sizes of
Windows as a Window layout to enable easy recall of useful Windows. This
allows, for example, a Window configuration consisting of the Group,
Position, Colour and Beam Windows to be stored and recalled at a button
press.

The system supports several standard views, including several oriented
towards programming and several oriented towards playback.

Window layouts are recalled by pressing CTRL and selecting one of the
top soft buttons.

The three spare buttons in the Windows section default to Layout 1
(Palettes), Layout 2 and Layout 3.


=== Shift Functions

The MagicQ lighting console uses SHIFT and CTRL buttons to enable access
to advanced features. There is a SHIFT button and a CTRL button adjacent
to the top corners of the touch screen in addition to the keys on the
keyboard.

The SHIFT button is used with the cursor keys to enable selection of
multiple items in Windows.

The ALT button is used on the Compact series (MQ40/60/70) to access
alternative functions such as Page Up, Page Down and the window sizing
options.


=== The Programmer

All recording of show data is carried out using the Programmer. The
Programmer takes priority over all playbacks, and channels. It can also
be used during live running to override the outputs – for example, for
changing the colour or gobo of intelligent heads.

The Programmer can be considered to be a table of channel level and
active flags for each of the channels patched onto the console.
Initially (and after the Programmer has been cleared) all the channel
levels are set to zero and all the channels are flagged as inactive.
When a channel is changed to be non zero the channel level for that
entry in the table is set to the new level and the channel is flagged as
active.

The console outputs any channels that are marked as active in the
Programmer at highest priority – i.e. they over-ride all other
playbacks.

To clear the Programmer press CLEAR. All channels will be deactivated
and all HTP channels will be set to zero. It is possible to force all
LTP channels to zero by using CTRL CLEAR.

The programmer can be set into a Blind mode using the BLIND button so
that the contents of the programmer do not affect the output of the
console. This allows programming adjustments to be made during a live
show and special effects to be “busked” in.


=== Help

The Help Window enables the operating manual to be viewed on-line. Press
the HELP button at any time to open the Help Window. To close the
window, press the CLOSE button.

Use the scroll encoder, the cursor keys, and the hyperlinks to navigate
through the manual. You can go directly to a particular section using
the top soft buttons, e.g. CONTENTS or QUICK START.

You can search through the manual by typing some text and pressing
SEARCH. To search for the same words again, press SEARCH AGAIN.
